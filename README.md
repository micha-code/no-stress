Are you an adventurous soul, who loves traveling from the deep bottom of your heart? In that case, this website is perfect for you! We are a community of adventurous women, who enjoy sharing their tips and tricks with others. More and more women travel solo, but they might often encounter negative reactions from others. We want to connect women travelers on one platform, where they are able to share their experiences, write reviews, and encourage other girls and women to have the courage to go beyond their everyday life.

This project was created as a part of Czechitas Web Digital Academy. Czechitas is a non-profit organization consisted of women and men whoall share a common goal to increase diversity in the IT world and to fight for a higher levelof digital proficiency among women, girls and children as well.

It was created by Michaela Davidova, Pavlina Mullerova and Ivona Zelinkova, with generous help from amazing mentors Pavel Kubik and Matej Simek. 

Let us know, if you find some bugs or suggestions for improvement. 

We hope you will enjoy it!

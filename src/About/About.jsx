        Are you an adventurous soul, who loves traveling from the deep bottom of
        your heart? In that case, this website is perfect for you! We are a
        community of adventurous women, who enjoy sharing their tips and tricks
        with others. More and more women travel solo, but they might often
        encounter negative reactions from others. We want to connect women
        travelers on one platform, where they are able to share their
        experiences, write reviews, and encourage other girls and women to have
        the courage to go beyond their everyday life. <br></br>
        <br></br>This project was created as a part of Czechitas Web Digital
        Academy.{' '}

            I love being outdoors and moving in all possible means - riding my
            bicycle, walking in the woods, swimming in the river in winter.
            Sleeping in the desert in my tent or just under a rock overhang
            makes me wake up smiling in the morning. I am a free spirit with
            freedom being my most appreciated value. Currently I make my living
            by helping to implement a human resources rmanagement software in a
            multinational. In the evenings I study React and JavaScript within
            Czechitas Digital Academy.

            I am addicted to the feeling of discovering and learning something
            new. My main driving force is curiosity. Having visited more than 65
            countries and lived in five of them, I am still craving new
            experiences. I am lucky to use my skills and passion in my
            professional life. I have marketing and business development
            experience from the multicultural environment in Europe and Asia,
            and I believe the storytelling and visual image make your products
            go viral. In the meantime, you will probably find me on the beach or
            in the mountains.
